# 🖌️ ReDraw
**Your image, drawn for you**  

ReDraw is a Python application that takes any image, processes it to detect its contours, and then uses your mouse to automatically "re-draw" the image for you in any drawing application on your screen. It's a fun and easy way to turn a complex photo into a simple, beautiful sketch.
