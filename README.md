**Your image, drawn for you**  

ReDraw is a Python application that takes any image, processes it to detect its contours, and then uses your mouse to automatically "re-draw" the image for you in any drawing application on your screen. It's a fun and easy way to turn a complex photo into a simple, beautiful sketch.

## ✨ Features
- **Image Processing** – Use a built-in UI to adjust brightness, threshold, and other settings to get the perfect outline of your image.  
- **Intelligent Contour Detection** – Powered by OpenCV, finds the key outlines of your image while ignoring unnecessary noise.  
- **Fill Mode** – Choose between simple outlines or filled shapes for a more solid drawing. (IN DEV) 
- **Search Functionality** – Find simple drawings and line art directly from the web.  
- **Local File Support** – Load your own images from your computer.  
- **User-Friendly Interface** – A clean, modern UI makes the process intuitive and fun.  
- **Save and Load** – Save your favorite images and their settings for quick reuse later.
